                            <h2>Rails 4.1.9 and 4.0.13 have been released!</h2>
                            <p class="article-info"> rafaelfranca, January 6, 2015</p>
                            <p>I am happy to announce that Rails 4.1.9 and 4.0.13 have been released.
    
                                This will be also the last release of 4.0 series as announced in a previous blog post.
                               
                            </p>
    
                            <p>As per our maintenance policy, the release of Rails 4.2.0 means bug fixes will only apply to 4-2-stable, regular security issues to 4.2.x, 4.1.x, and severe security issues to 4.2.x, 4.1.x, and 3.2.x. In addition to these already stated commitments, I agreed to also apply bug fixes to 4-1-stable until the Rails 5 release.
                                
                                As before, we will announce in a future blog post when we will drop bug fixes support for Rails 4.1.</p>

                            <h2>This week in Rails: a new beginning</h2>
                            <p class="article-info">chancancode, January 10, 2015</p>
    
                            <p>It was only less than a year ago when I sent the first issue of This week in Rails to a total of 14 recipients, discussing some of the latest and greatest additions to the Rails codebase.
    
                                43 weeks later, this little hobby project has evolved into a true community effort â€“- we have assembled an amazing team of editors and other volunteers (join us!), keeping 2000 subscribers in the loop and highlighting some key contributions to our beloved web framework every week.
                             </p>
    
                            <p>
                                I am incredibly excited to announce that starting this week, we will be cross- posting the content from the newsletter to the Riding Rails blog. With this, we hope to reach even more members of our wonderful community, increase transparency, involve more of you in the decision-making processes and maybe even inspire some future contributors!
                                
                                I would like to thank my team at Brewhouse and Goodbits for supporting the project and getting it off the ground, as well as all the volunteers who helped along the way. Of course, huge thank you to all of the Rails contributors who did all the hard work!

                        <p>I am a nature lover and think that it should be preserved.
                             Man has done there ill wills to it and done tries to 
                             separate themselves from it the Truth is... our lives 
                             depend on it. Will you act in such a way to preserve it?
                              Its our Solemn Duty to be good stewards.
